For a full-stack social media app using microservices architecture, you'll need to divide the functionalities into independent, modular services. Here’s a breakdown of the essential microservices you’ll need, along with their responsibilities:

---

## **1. User Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - User registration and authentication.
   - Manage user profiles.
   - Handle follow/unfollow relationships.

### Key Features:
   - Login and token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
   - CRUD operations for user profiles.
   - Manage followers and following.

---

## **2. Post Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Create, update, delete, and fetch posts.
   - Manage media uploads (e.g., images, videos).

### Key Features:
   - API for CRUD operations on posts.
   - Integration with a storage service for media (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
   - Feed generation (simple chronological feed for MVP).

---

## **3. Like Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Handle likes on posts.

### Key Features:
   - Add or remove likes for posts.
   - Return the total count of likes for a post.
   - Fetch posts liked by a user.

---

## **4. Comment Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Manage comments on posts.

### Key Features:
   - Add, edit, and delete comments.
   - Fetch comments for a specific post.

---

## **5. Notification Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Notify users of events like likes, comments, and follows.

### Key Features:
   - Real-time notifications using WebSockets or a message broker (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ).
   - Mark notifications as read/unread.
   - Store notification history.

---

## **6. Search Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Enable search functionality across users and posts.

### Key Features:
   - Full-text search for posts.
   - Search for users by username, name, or other attributes.
   - Utilize Elasticsearch or similar tools for efficient searching.

---

## **7. Media Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Manage uploading and serving media files.

### Key Features:
   - Handle file uploads (images, videos, etc.).
   - Generate URLs for serving media securely.
   - Compress or resize images/videos (optional).

---

## **8. Analytics Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Collect and analyze user activity.

### Key Features:
   - Track metrics like post views, likes, and comments over time.
   - Generate reports on engagement trends.
   - Use a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for scalable data storage.

---

## **9. API Gateway**
### Responsibilities:
   - Central entry point for all client requests.
   - Route requests to the appropriate microservice.

### Key Features:
   - Manage authentication and rate limiting.
   - Aggregate data from multiple services for efficiency.
   - Use tools like Kong or NGINX.

---

## **10. Load Balancer Service**
### Responsibilities:
   - Generate personalized feeds for users.

### Key Features:
   - Fetch posts from users the current user follows.
   - Order posts by relevance (likes, comments) or time.
   - Use Redis or similar tools for fast feed generation.

---

### **Communication Between Services**
1. **Message Broker**: Use RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis for asynchronous communication (e.g., notifications or analytics).
2. **REST or gRPC APIs**: For synchronous communication between services.
3. **Database Integration**: Each service should manage its own database or data store to ensure loose coupling.

---

### **Deployment**
- Use **Docker** to containerize each service.
- Orchestrate with **Kubernetes** for scalability and resilience.
